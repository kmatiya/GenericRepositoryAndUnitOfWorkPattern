# GenericRepositoryAndUnitOfWorkPattern
A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers (like Entity Framework). It allows you to pull a record or number of records out of datasets, and then have those records to work on acting like an in-memory domain object collection, and you can also update or delete records within those data set, and the mapping code encapsulated by the Repository will carry out the appropriate operations behind the scenes.  Repository pattern is a way to implement data access by encapsulating the set of objects persisted in a data store and the operations performed over them, providing a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer.
